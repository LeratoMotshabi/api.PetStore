Features

Test Execution & Reporting: Implemented TestNG Listeners for generating Extent Reports to provide detailed execution logs and test results.

Configuration Management: API routes are stored in a properties file and called form endpoints, enabling easy updates and reusability.

Data-Driven Testing:

Utilizes Excel files to read test data dynamically.

Ensures test coverage across multiple scenarios.

Payload Management: Uses structured payloads to send requests efficiently.

API Testing Coverage: Includes tests for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests for various Pet Store API functionalities.
